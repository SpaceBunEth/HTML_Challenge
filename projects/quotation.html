        <p>In section we will be looking at html elements that provide quotation and citation to text</p>
        <p>The paragraph below is placed in a quotation block. The tag being used is a <code>blockquote</code> with a <code>q</code> and <code>cite</code>tag within.</p>
        <blockquote>
            As I try to understand meanings for all things. I find myself falling <em>deeper</em> and <strong>deeper</strong>
            into ignorance. Not am I, just a man, but a child in a forever aging vessal. Damned by the laws that govern this existance. <q>For time has 
            imprisoned us.</q><cite>In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings, Song by Dead Can Dance</cite> 
            And though the evils of this world know no bounds. Why must I struggle so dearly?

            <bdo dir="rtl">If it were within our power,<br />
                Beyond the reach of slavish pride.<br />
                To no longer harbour grievances,<br />
                Behind the mask's opportunists facade.<br />
                We could welcome the responsibility<br />
                Like a long lost friend,<br />
                And re-establish the kingdom of laughter<br />
                In the dolls house once again.<br />
                For time has imprisoned us<br />
                In the order of our years,<br />
                In the discipline of our ways<br />
                And in the passing of momentary stillness<br />
                We can view our chaos in motion<br />
                And the subsequent collisions of fools<br />
                Well versed in the subtle art of slavery.
