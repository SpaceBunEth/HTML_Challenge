        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>You won't see any comments here. Why?</p>
        <p>Comments are meant to not be seen. They are a useful <em>hidden</em> tool programmers and developers us to communicate with one another. 
            They allow use to leave messages behind within the program so future developers can get
            a better idea of what and how we did things.
        </p>
        <p>You can write comments using this syntax: <code><mark>&lt;!-- --></mark></code></p>
        <p>Open up Dev-Tools to see a Comment!</p> 
        <!-- Hello World! -->
